    "# Python and R\n",
    "Explore the basics of these two open-source programming languages, the key differences that set them apart and how to choose the right one. In many ways, the two open source languages are very similar. Free to download for everyone, both languages are well suited for data science tasks. The main difference is that Python is a general-purpose programming language, while R has its roots in statistical analysis."

    "Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that emphasizes code readability through its generous use of white space. Released in 1989, Python is easy to learn and a favorite of programmers and developers. In fact, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, just behind Java and C.\n",
